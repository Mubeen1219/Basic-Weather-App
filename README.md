# Basic-Weather-App
Basic weather app allows users to fetch and display current weather data for a given location. This app will connect to a weather API, retrieve weather information, and present it in a user-friendly format. For simplicity, we'll use the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides free access to weather data with an API key.
